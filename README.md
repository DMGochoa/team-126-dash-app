### Features

On each page we display different views that can be used to explore Bogot치
or know more about the city, our pages are:

* Home page: explore the map of Bogot치 and filter by locality in order to
see key points such as hotels, touristic attractions, wifi hotspots, public
transport and malls.
* Tu perfil: a set of 15 questions will tell you more about your tourist
profile and give you useful recommendations that you can try on your next visit!
* Delitos: know more about the crime profile of Bogot치 by locality or time of day
* Sobre nosotros: know more about the people that made this app possible, team 126
and information sources.

### Architecture

We have two data folders, `data` and `data-cleaned` which contain the
raw information that will be exported and consumed in our application
mainly on the `app.py` file.

Our `app.py` file is the heart of the application, it has the majority of
the callbacks supported and is a place where we import our components and
pages to add interactivity and states.

Additionally, we have the `/pages` and `/components` folders which are
responsible for hosting the re-usable components and main pages of the app.

Finally, we also have an `/assets` folder that hosts any image or styles.
